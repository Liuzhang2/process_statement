2. Connect with your past:
   1. What resources or strategies have been most supportive in your learning?
   2. Share a challenging concept or activity that you encountered and how you overcame it.
3. Look ahead:
   1. How do you anticipate applying your learning in future contexts?\
   *Recognize that even if you do not plan to continue in the field of quantitative text analysis, the skills you have developed are transferable to other domains and also have value in everyday life.*
